# func_redis

func_redis is a asterisk module to use Redis from the dialplan.
It uses hiredis as library for redis.
I have tested it in Asterisk 11.6 certified version and asterisk 13.9.

## Motivation of the project

This project is motivated by the need to share information between different
asterisk in both active-active and active-passive scheme.

In the case of passive-active scheme if you use AstDB for storing data, 
when system switch over, the data in AstDB isn't in the passive node,
so some functionality is lost, using Redis instead of AstDB, the active
node and the passive one can access the data, even the possibility of 
making an passive active redis scheme in this case the active asterisk 
attack the active redis and the passive asterisk attacks the passive 
redis with this scheme you can have on the same machine redis and Asterisk.

In the case of both active-active scheme asterisk can share information easily by redis.

func_redis is not a drop in replacement of AstDB, internally asterisk uses AstDB,
for example to keep registry of the phones.

You can use an agi script or a system call to a script to use redis from the dialplan
but the performance is low compared to a asterisk module and the integration is worst.

## Instalation
1. Install the dependencies
2. ```git clone https://github.com/m-nik/func_redis.git```
3. ```cd func_redis```
4. ```mkdir build```
5. ```cd build```
6. ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..```
7. ```make```
8. ```make install```
9. ```make doc```
10. ```#make samples```


## Uninstall 
- ```make unistall```

## Using func_redis

In order to use the func_redis you have to configure the settings for the module 
in the file func_redis.conf. There is an example in samples/func_redis.conf.sample, if you 
run make samples it will copy this file to /etc/asterisk

Here an example of the file :

```sh
echo "
[general]
; host of the redis server
; if not defined, use default of 127.0.0.1
hostname=127.0.0.1

; port of the redis server
; if not defined, use default of 6379
port=6379

; database index in redis
; if not defined, use default of 0
database=0

; password for redis server
; if not defined, authentication will not be used
;password=s3cr3tp@ssw0rd

; connection time out when connecting to the server
; if not defined, use a default of 5 seconds
timeout=3

; send a BGSAVE on connection close/module unload
; if not defined, use a default of false
bgsave=false
" > /etc/asterisk/func_redis.conf
```

### load module in asterisk
`asterisk>` ```module load func_redis.so``` 


### Using func_redis from the Dialplan
Func redis have two apis one similar to AstDB and another generic, if you don't want to
learn how redis work use the AstDB API but if you know how redis work you can use the generic API
that is more powerful. All the redis dialplan functions saves its results in REDIS_RESULT it is a string always,
if the response is an redis array it puts the elements in a coma separated way like `value1,value2,value3` ,
if the result is a redis nil the REDIS_RESULT is equal to `"nil"`. If there was errors the channel variable 
REDIS_ERROR is filled with the error.

#### AstDB API
##### Set a key value
```same => n,Set(REDIS(key)=${VALUE})```

##### Get the value from a key
```same => n,Set(VALUE=${REDIS(key)})```

##### Delete a key
```same => n,NoOp(Deleting test key ${REDIS_DELETE(key)})```

##### Check if a key exists
```same => n,GotoIf(${REDIS_EXISTS(key)}?exists:doesnt_exist)```

#### Generic API 
##### Every redis comand
```
same => n,NoOp(REDIS_COMMAND(PUBLISH channel message))
same => n,NoOp(REDIS_COMMAND(MGET key1 key2 key3))
same => n,NoOp(REDIS_COMMAND(LPOP alist))
```

### Using func_redis from the CLI

You can use these commands related to func_redis in the Asterisk CLI 

1. ```redis show [pattern]```
    Shows all the key values.
    [pattern] pattern to match keys
    Examples :
        - h?llo matches hello, hallo and hxllo
        - h*llo matches hllo and heeeello
        - h[ae]llo matches hello and hallo, but not hillo
    
2. ```redis set <key> <value>```
    Sets the key's <key> value to <value>.
    
3. ```redis del <key>```
    Deletes the key-value pair in redis.

## Develop environment

#### Start Developing
 
This repo have a Vagrantfile with the needed configuration to have a functional yet basic development environment.
To use it you should run
 
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
 
You can find the project in the vm in the folder /func_redis. 
You can make the changes that you wish and then 
 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
make install
```
 
#### Testing the module
 
I don't use a proper test suite but in exchange I test the module making use of the dialplan,
call files and local channels, to run the test

```make dialplan_test```

## Code security and tools

To check if the code uses insecure functions and make some security checks run

```make security_checks```

for security checks it uses the nexts static analyzers :

- cppcheck
- graudit
- flawfinder
